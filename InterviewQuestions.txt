what is difference between Tuple and list in python?
Ans:To put it lightly, tuples are lists which can't be edited. Once you create a tuple,
         you cannot edit it, it is immutable. Lists on the other hand are mutable, you can 
         edit them, they work like the array object in JavaScript or PHP. You can add items, 
         delete items from a list; but you can't do that to a tuple, tuples have a fixed size.
